# Charged Higgs Phenomenology in di-bjet channel with $H^{\pm} \rightarrow W^{\pm}h$ in 2HDM Type-II using Machine Learning Technique

The latest LHC collaborations results on  $\sigma_{H^{\pm}}BR(H^{\pm} \rightarrow \tau^{\pm}\nu)$ and $\sigma_{H^{\pm}}BR(H^{+} \rightarrow t\Bar{b})$ are used to
impose constraints on the charged Higgs $H^{\pm}$ parameters
within the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). But it leaves $1.5 \leq tan \beta \leq 3$ window unexplored where the $BR(H^{\pm} \rightarrow W^{\pm}h)$ becomes sizable for $m_{H^{\pm}} > m_{t}$. In this manuscript $H^{\pm} \rightarrow W^{\pm}h$ is investigated with neutral Higgs boson decaying to a pair of b-quarks and the discovery prospects of charged Higgs boson is discussed. In particular, the analysis is optimized by putting the kinematic cuts and prospects of using Machine Learning Technique to derive values of $\sigma\times BR$ needed for a $5 \sigma$ discovery at the LHC.
